# **Notes**
-> In Numpy, number of dimensions of the array is called RANK of the array.<br/>
-> A tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension is known as SHAPE of the array.<br/>
-> Each array in numpy has a datatype (dtype) object.<br/>
-> Datatype can either be explicitly mentioned or else numpy guesses the datatype from the data present in the array.<br/>
-> Shape of an array can be changed, without modifying its data.<br/>
-> Two different arrays can bet stacked either horizonatally or vertically, using respective methods.<br/>
-> An array can be splitted into multiple sub-arrays using split() method.<br/>
